Description: GObject introspection data for magpie
 magpie is a X11 window manager and compositor library. It contains
 functionality related to, among other things, window management, window
 compositing, focus tracking, workspace management, keybindings and monitor
 configuration.
 .
 Magpie is a soft-fork of GNOME mutter v43.x tailored for the requirements
 of the budgie-desktop.
 .
 Internally it uses a fork of Cogl, a hardware acceleration abstraction
 library used to simplify usage of OpenGL pipelines, as well as a fork
 of Clutter, a scene graph and user interface toolkit.
 .
 This package contains the GObject introspection data which may be
 used to generate dynamic bindings.
